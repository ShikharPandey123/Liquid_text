# Dynamic Text Spacing with Pinch Gesture

This project demonstrates dynamic text spacing and interaction using pinch gestures for adjusting the line height and a smooth progress indicator. The application leverages **React**, **React Spring**, and **@use-gesture/react** to create a seamless, interactive experience for manipulating text spacing.

## Features
- **Pinch Gesture Support**: Adjust the line height of the text by performing a pinch gesture (using two fingers).
- **Overlap Toggle**: Enable or disable text overlap with a button.
- **Reset**: Reset the line spacing and overlap state to their default values.
- **Progress Bar**: A dynamic progress bar indicating the scaling factor.
